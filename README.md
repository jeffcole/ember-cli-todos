# Ember CLI Todos

## Hi

You might want to make an [Ember][emberjs] app. You might have heard that [Ember CLI][ember-cli] is a neat thing to use, and that it will be included in the forthcoming [Ember 2.0][ember-2.0]. As you develop your app, you might want to look at an example app, like the Ember [getting started][ember-getting-started] app. Unfortunately, that app has not yet been updated to use Ember CLI.

This app implements the Ember getting started Todos app, using CLI features where possible. It is implemented in [CoffeeScript][coffeescript], because it's good for your health and well-being.
